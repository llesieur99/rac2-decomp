A work-in-progress **matching decompilation** of *Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando* (Insomniac Games, 2003) for the PlayStation 2 (`SCUS_972.68`, **USA v2.00**), part of the **[OpenRAC](https://openrac.dev)** initiative. The goal is C/C++ that compiles to a byte-identical copy of the retail executable and its 27 level overlays.

> [!NOTE]
> This repository contains **no game assets, retail executables, or disassembly**. You must provide your own legally obtained copy of the game. Read [`LEGAL.md`](LEGAL.md) first; `scripts/legal_check.py` enforces it in CI.

> [!NOTE]
> AI-assisted research and tooling under human direction. A matching claim needs a byte-for-byte comparison against the pinned executable; an AI answer is not evidence.

## Progress

<!-- generated-progress:start -->
Recorded validation on **9 October 2026**:

| Scope | Integrated C functions / placements | Matched C bytes |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Boot | 312 functions | 18,292 |
| 27 level overlays | 11,083 placements | 794,532 |
| Native overlay subset, included above | 6,687 placements | 554,596 |
| **Total C coverage** | **Boot + all 27 overlays** | **812,824 / 48,788,176 (1.6660%)** |
<!-- generated-progress:end -->

Proofs in [`progress/`](progress/) were measured on **USA v1.01** and move to v2.00 once its catalogues are regenerated; v2.00 disc, boot and all 27 overlays are already pinned ([`docs/REGIONS.md`](docs/REGIONS.md)).

<!-- unique-code-progress:start -->
| Metric | Matched C bytes | Total code bytes | Progress |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Conservative unique EE code (unsupported extents uncollapsed) | 221,744 | 44,400,168 | 0.4994% |
| Loaded code (boot + 27 overlays) | 812,824 | 48,788,176 | 1.6660% |

Structurally supported function extents cover 40,075,248 loaded EE bytes; 231,732 EE bytes remain unresolved. VU code excluded: 86,368 bytes.
Provisional representative partition: 37,641,816 bytes (certified: false); no global progress percentage is inferred from this partition.
Conservative global partition retains unknown extents and gaps without deduplication: 8,626,560 loaded EE bytes have unsupported boundaries. The total follows the stated grouping policy and is not a certified original-source size. Supported subset: 221,744 / 35,773,608 unique bytes.

Shared boot binding: 22,576 static edges in combined pinned reference images. Runtime code preservation is unproved. See [the binding and remaining-duplication audit](docs/BOOT-SHARED-CODE-VERIFICATION.md).

## Quick Start

1. Clone and install: `git clone https://github.com/OpenRAC/rac2-gc-decomp && pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Put `SCUS_972.68` from your own disc in `baserom/` (SHA-1 `4124a79c1e5a1ceb56f514df0dbbc11f072af56f`).
3. Check your setup: `python scripts/doctor.py --region v2 --iso <your.iso>`
4. Prepare the reference (needs [Wrench](https://github.com/chaoticgd/wrench) `wrenchbuild`):
   `python scripts/setup.py --region v2 --iso <your.iso> --runtime <private dir> --wrench <wrenchbuild>`
5. Pick a function: `python scripts/function_size_rank.py --category small --status todo --ascending`

6. Fetch the legacy SN Systems toolchain and SDK yourself (community mirrors, **not** part of this repository and git-ignored; check their licences before use):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AngheloAlf/SN-Systems-ProDG_for_PS2_3.01 toolchain/sn-prodg-3.01
   git clone https://github.com/AngheloAlf/sce_ps2_sdk_24 toolchain/sn-prodg-24
   ```

Compiler and linker requirements are in [`toolchain/README.md`](toolchain/README.md); the full walkthrough is [`docs/START-HERE.md`](docs/START-HERE.md).
