# Legal scope of this project

This repository is a **matching decompilation** of *Ratchet & Clank 2: Going Commando*
(2003, PS2, SCUS-97268 / SCES-51607 depending on region) — the approach used by projects
like sm64/papermario/mm-decomp/Klonoa-decomp: produce C source that, when compiled,
reassembles byte-for-byte (or as close as practically achievable) to the original
retail executable.

This is a **different legal posture** than a clean-room reimplementation.
Be deliberate about it:

## What this repo does and does not contain

- **Never** the original disc image, `SCUS`/`SLES` executable, ELF,
  or any file extracted directly from a copyrighted disc/PSN copy.
- **Never** any asset binary (textures, models, audio, level data) extracted
  from the original game, and never the ROM/ISO/executable itself.
- Build **scripts and config** (`splat.yaml`, symbol maps, linker scripts,
  Makefiles) that describe *how* to reconstruct the original layout from a
  baserom the user supplies themselves.
- **Not** `asm/`. The MIPS disassembly `splat` produces carries the
  retail executable's instruction bytes, so it is generated locally by
  each contributor from their own baserom and is gitignored.
  That keeps this file consistent with rule 1 below.
  (It was committed earlier in the project and removed from the tree on
  2026-09-16. The history has since been rewritten: no commit in this
  repository contains `asm/` or any `.s` file.) The setup
  is pinned (`requirements.txt`, `config/splat.yaml`, the baserom sha1),
  and a regenerated `asm/` rebuilds the image byte-identically.
- Progressively, hand-written C source in `src/` that a contributor has
  decompiled from the (locally generated) disassembly in `asm/` and cleaned up to compile back
  to matching (or `INCLUDE_ASM`-stubbed, not-yet-matching) object code.
- Non-matching helper tooling under `scripts/`.

## What a contributor/user must supply themselves

- Their own legally owned copy of the game (disc or legally obtained PSN
  ISO), dumped by them.
- The retail executable itself, `SCUS_972.68` (USA v1.01), copied from their own disc
  into `baserom/`, which is outside version control (see `.gitignore`).
  It is used locally to run `splat` and to check the build against
  retail, and is never committed or redistributed through this repo.

## Why this is a bigger legal step than an engine-port project

Recreating the original binary's *exact* code shape (not just its
behavior, rewritten independently) sits closer to the disputed edge of
fair use / interoperability doctrine than either format-reverse-engineering
or "observe behavior, reimplement independently" does. The established
decomp-scene norm — and the one this repo follows — is:

1. Never distribute the original ROM/ISO/executable or anything extracted
   directly from it (textures, models, audio, raw disassembly).
2. Only distribute the *tooling and source* needed to rebuild a matching
   executable from a copy the end user already owns and supplies locally.
3. Treat the resulting repo as source-available for research/preservation/
   modding purposes, not as a way to distribute the game or its assets.

This mirrors the norm under which sm64/oot/papermario/many other
matching-decomp projects have operated for years without takedown, but it
is not risk-free, and it is a deliberate choice specific to this project —
not one to extend further (e.g. to hosting extracted assets, or a prebuilt
ROM) without thinking it through again.

## Sources used for the code

The C is reconstructed from the retail executable, with open-source
libraries (newlib, libgcc) and public projects about this game as
references. Sony's SDK source, samples and headers, and leaked or NDA
material of any kind, are not used (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, "Sources"). Code
found to have been derived from such material is reverted to assembly.

## Practical implication

This repo will not build into a runnable game for anyone who doesn't
already own a copy and dump it themselves. Cloning it gets you build
scripts and (as decompilation progresses) increasingly complete C source —
never assets, never the executable.
