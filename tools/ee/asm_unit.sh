# asm_unit.sh — assemble a whole compiled unit (cc1 output .s that pulls in
# per-function asm via INCLUDE_ASM's `.include "going-decompiled/asm/.../F.s"`)
# into a single object, applying the VU0 fixup to the included asm.
#
# Runs INSIDE the ee-build container (colima x86 VM):
#   docker --context colima-ee-x86 run --rm -v "$PWD":/work ee-build \
#       sh tools/ee/asm_unit.sh <region> <unit.s> <out.o>
#   e.g. ... sh tools/ee/asm_unit.sh usa /work/build/cod_015180.s out.o
#
# WHY the mirror+cd dance:
#   INCLUDE_ASM hardcodes a *source-relative* include path
#   (`going-decompiled/asm/<region>/nonmatchings/<unit>/<func>.s`). GNU as
#   resolves a relative `.include` against the CWD before any -I dir, so we
#   cannot redirect it with -I alone. Instead we build a filtered MIRROR of the
#   asm tree (each .s passed through tools/ee/vu0_fixup.sed, which only rewrites
#   VU0 Q/ACC operands and is a no-op everywhere else) plus macro.inc, then run
#   `as` with its CWD at the mirror root so every `.include` resolves to the
#   fixed-up copy. Encoding is byte-identical to the original (the fixup only
#   adds the `$` prefix GNU as requires on the Q/ACC special registers).

# LAYOUT GATE (#1103, FACT #8551, FACT #8553). Every -G8 rule below matches
# cc1's exact line layout - a TAB indent, the mnemonic, a TAB, operands with no
# whitespace (`/^\t(bnel|...)\t/`, `/^\t(sw|lw|...)\t\$r,sym$/`). An input in
# any other layout matches nothing, prints nothing and exits 0, which reads
# exactly like a clean subject, and its -G0 run reads 0 as well, so the two
# dead numbers agree and look like confirmation. That is a hand-written control
# seed's failure, never cc1's, so it is refused here with no object and no
# assembler output (a warning inside a readout is still a readout, #1037).
#   - input missing or unreadable, at any -G: `as` would read an empty stdin
#     and write an empty object at rc 0 (a seed outside the container mount);
#   - -G8, instruction lines present but none in cc1 layout (the whole seed is
#     dead). An input with no instruction lines at all is not refused: a unit
#     whose every function is INCLUDE_ASM is exactly that (usa cod/0213D0);
#   - -G8, any branch the delay-slot guard holds, or any integer load/store of
#     a bare symbol, written outside cc1 layout (that line is dead even when
#     the rest of the seed is live). A bare-symbol memop counts as live only
#     when it matches MEMOP_RE, the one spelling the slot rule keys on, so a
#     trailing comment or space on one is refused (FACT #8616): the slot rule
#     cannot see it. MEMOP_RE is therefore required to cover every spelling
#     cc1 itself emits for such a memop, and that is a measured property, not
#     a definition: the first version missed cc1's `name.N` function-static
#     (`lw $3,s_count.3`) and refused real cc1 output (FACT #8652). The known
#     cc1 spellings are listed at MEMOP_RE. Inline asm
#     reaches the unit .s verbatim and outside cc1 layout, but none of it is a
#     held branch or a bare-symbol memop: lq/sq/cvt.w.s in -G8 units, `la` in
#     the 2.96 arm, syscall/COP0 shims in -G0 cod/015180 (every USA/EU image
#     and objdiff .s, #1103).
# Exit 2 and the `asm_unit.sh: FAIL:` prefix are deliberately NOT the delay-slot
# guard's `REFUSED` (rc 1 from `.error`): a control that counts WARNING/REFUSED
# lines must not read this refusal as its seed firing.

# Assemble with CWD at the mirror so source-relative `.include`s resolve there.
cd "$FIXROOT"
# Apply the cc1 `move`->`daddu` fixup to the (cc1-emitted) unit asm before
# assembling. The .include'd original asm is read from the mirror by `as` and is
# untouched (it has explicit `daddu`, never the `move` pseudo).
#
# At -G8 also fix the `la` pseudo (bare `la $r,SYM` and the `la $r,SYM+OFF`
# form cc1 emits for address-plus-constant, e.g. text/198FA0 func_0029C418).
# The SN ee-as expands both with 32-bit adds (proven by the original bytes):
# `addiu $r,$gp,%gp_rel(SYM)` for a small-data symbol, `lui $r,%hi(SYM);
# addiu $r,$r,%lo(SYM)` for an absolute one. GNU as uses the 64-bit `daddiu`
# in both cases, so we expand the pseudo ourselves, deciding smallness exactly
# like the assembler does - from the `.extern SYM, SIZE` directives in the
# same unit .s, keyed on the BASE symbol for the +OFF form (first directive
# wins, matching observed GAS behaviour; a file-scope __asm__(".extern SYM,
# 16") in the C overrides cc1's own size, which is how a cc1-small but
# assembler-absolute original symbol is reproduced). Not applied at -G0,
# where cc1 never relies on gp-relative `la`.
#
# Also reproduce the SN ee-as COP1 load-delay flush (proven by the original
# bytes in text/183178): when a `.set noreorder` region begins directly after
# a cop1 load macro (`l.s`/`lwc1`), the SN assembler conservatively pads the
# load delay with a `nop` before entering the region (it can no longer reorder
# inside it). GNU as treats r5900 cop1 loads as interlocked and emits nothing,
# so we insert the nop ourselves. (That holds for a LOAD: a register lwc1 and a
# symbolic l.s assemble with no pad at the boundary, while an mtc1 there does
# get one - the mtc1 rule below is the other case; FACT #8641.) Not
# applied at -G0: no currently-matched -G0 function has a cop1-load/noreorder
# boundary, and the -G0 units' matches were proven WITHOUT the pad.
#
# At -G8 also expand the `li.s` float-constant pseudo when its IEEE bits need
# a 2-insn materialisation (low half nonzero). The SN ee-as always expands
# `li.s $fN,<c>` inline as `lui $at,hi[; ori $at,$at,lo]; mtc1 $at,$fN`
# (proven by the original bytes in text/1907F0 func_00290EF8); GNU as does
# the same at -G0 (which is why the -G0 units never hit this) and for
# lui-only constants at any -G, but with a nonzero -G it places an
# ori-needing constant in a gp-relative `.lit4` pool instead. We pre-expand
# exactly like the SN assembler so no `.lit4` is emitted. Not applied at -G0
# (GNU as is already byte-identical there).
#
# And the inverse hazard of the COP1 flush above: when a `.set noreorder`
# region begins directly after an `mfc1`, GNU as pads the cop1-move hazard
# with a nop at the region boundary; the SN ee-as does not (the r5900
# interlocks, proven by the original bytes in text/1907F0 func_00290EF8:
# `mfc1 $a3,$f1` directly followed by `beqz $a3`). We hold the mfc1 and emit
# it just inside the region, where GNU as adds no hazard padding. Not applied
# at -G0 (no matched -G0 function has an mfc1/noreorder boundary).
#
# At -G8 also hoist a multi-insn symbolic memory macro out of a branch delay
# slot (proven by the original bytes in text/250080 func_00350F78): cc1
# treats a cc1-small symbol's `sw $0,SYM` as one insn and schedules it into
# the branch delay slot; when the `.extern SYM,16` override makes the
# assembler expand it absolutely (lui $at / sw), the SN ee-as places the
# expansion BEFORE the branch and fills the slot with a nop, while GNU as
# splits it across the branch ("macro expanded into multiple instructions in
# a branch delay slot" warning + the store half landing dead after the jump
# - outright broken code, so this can never affect an already-matched
# function). We reproduce the SN placement: macro first, then the branch,
# then a nop in the slot. Only inside `.set noreorder` regions and only for
# symbols the .extern size map does NOT class as small.
#
# The hoist is only a legal reordering when the slot insn is independent of
# the branch (task #979, FACT #8385). Two shapes are not, and hoisting them
# assembles a different program from cc1's: a BRANCH-LIKELY slot (annulled
# when the branch falls through; hoisted, it runs unconditionally) and a slot
# LOAD whose destination the branch reads or links into (hoisted, it replaces
# the value the branch tests). A linking branch writes its link register
# before the slot runs, so a slot load into it or a slot store of it is the
# same class (#993, FACT #8423); for `jalr` that register is the rd operand,
# $31 only by default. The ROM has neither next to an absolute macro,
# in either placement (USA SCUS_972.68, all branches: 0 of the 61 `lui $at;
# op; branch; nop` sites and 0 of the 3 `lui $at; branch; op` sites), so what
# the SN ee-as did there is unobservable and a function carrying one cannot
# match as written. For those we emit cc1's semantics instead - `lui $at`
# before the branch, the %lo access in the slot - and say so on stderr naming
# the function. A branch that reads $at itself has no correct placement for
# a $at expansion: that is refused with an `.error`, so the unit fails loudly.
#
# At -G8 also honor cc1's `#.set volatile` markers at branch boundaries
# (proven by the original bytes in text/250080 func_00352B90): when cc1
# declines to fill a delay slot itself (volatile memop directly before a
# reorder-mode branch), the SN ee-as left the slot as a nop, while GNU as
# 2.40 reorders the volatile store INTO the slot (the `.set volatile`
# directive is emitted commented-out and ignored). We pin the branch in a
# noreorder/nop wrapper exactly when the directly preceding instruction
# carried the novolatile marker.
#
# At -G8 also keep a 128-bit lq/sq out of a reorder-mode `j $31` slot
# (proven by the original bytes of text/1A8180 func_002A9A68 / func_002A8948,
# text/183558 func_00284028 / func_002839D8, text/16E980 func_00270EB8 and
# cod/015180 func_0012B0D8: `sq; jr $31; nop` in all seven such return tails
# in the USA asm tree, versus two `jr $31; lq/sq` slots, both in hand-written
# asm). cc1 leaves the return unfilled and in reorder mode after an lq/sq;
# the SN ee-as left the slot empty, while GNU as 2.40 swaps the lq/sq into
# it. We pin the return in a noreorder/nop wrapper exactly when the directly
# preceding instruction is an lq/sq.
#
# The same pin holds a `mflo`/`mfhi` out of the return slot (task #919, FACT
# #8243, FACT #8203): cc1 emits `mflo $2; #nop; j $31` in reorder mode and GNU
# as 2.40 swaps the mflo into the slot, while the ROM keeps `mflo; jr $31; nop`
# in all three such tails (USA text/178E88 func_0027A0D0, cod/0321A0
# func_00133988; EU cod/0321A0 func_001339E8) and has no `jr $31; mflo/mfhi`
# anywhere (0 in USA and EU, counted on the decoded ROM words). Not extended
# to other branches or to mflo1/mfhi1: the ROM has no mf* in any branch slot
# either, but only the return tail has a measured function behind it.
#
# And a `cvt.s.w` out of ANY reorder-mode branch slot (task #1053, FACT #8499,
# FACT #8507): cc1 emits `mtc1; cvt.s.w; <branch>` with the slot unfilled and
# GNU as 2.40 swaps the cvt.s.w into it, while the ROM has 0 cvt.s.w in any
# branch delay slot (0 of 598 USA, 0 of 602 EU, every branch kind, against an
# 18-28% slot rate for mov.s/mul.s/add.s/sub.s) and keeps `cvt.s.w; <branch>;
# nop` at 9 USA / 7 EU sites (b, jal, jr - e.g. text/235FE8
# GuiListSetScrollPos). We pin the branch in a noreorder/nop wrapper exactly
# when the directly preceding instruction is a cvt.s.w with no label between
# them. Where GNU as could not have swapped (a label between), the wrapper
# would assemble the same bytes; the reset only keeps the rule's scope exact.
# Not extended to div.s/cvt.w.s: the ROM keeps those out of slots too, but
# that is observed, not tested as a rule.
# (cc1 is a Win32 PE - its .s lines end in CRLF, hence the \r-stripping.)
#
# Last, at every -G, the scoped Ps2EeAs `dli` expansion (RULING #8549, task
# #1105). It runs as tools/ee/ps2eeas_dli.awk, the final pass before `as`. A cc1
# `dli` is replaced by SN Ps2EeAs.exe's expansion only at a site listed in
# tools/ee/ps2eeas_dli_sites.txt: same region, same enclosing `.ent` function,
# same operands. The expansion comes from the row's words, which the ROM carries
# at that address; tools/ee/ps2eeas_dli_sites.py re-derives every row. Every
# other `dli` stays GNU as's: tree-wide, Ps2EeAs's form is wrong in at least 11
# engine chains per region (FACT #8518). Splat's asm carries no `dli`, so an
# INCLUDE_ASM body is never touched. A malformed allowlist row emits an `.error`.
# A listed `dli` directly before a non-likely reorder-mode branch is REFUSED,
# because GNU as slots the expansion's last word where Ps2EeAs does not (FACT
# #8623, FACT #8653; the awk's header has the measured branch lists). So is a
# listed `dli` under `.set nomacro`, which Ps2EeAs rejects (FACT #8698, task
# #1170). Each prints its own `asm_unit.sh: FAIL:` line naming the site.
#
# `as` fed an empty stream still writes a valid-looking object at rc 0, so the
# pass is checked from outside as well as by its own status. Each of these is
# `asm_unit.sh: FAIL:`, exit 2, no object, naming its condition and the
# allowlist's row count:
#   (a) the allowlist has no valid row - 0 bytes, comments only, or every row
#       malformed. A 0-byte file used to make the pass swallow the whole unit
#       and exit 0 (FACT #8640); a comment-only one transformed nothing, so every
#       dli control measured GNU's output while reporting success. Each of the
#       three prints its own line (task #1170): a truncated file and a
#       deliberately emptied one are different repairs;
#   (b) the pass (or the rule pass before it, at -G8) exits non-zero;
#   (c) the pass prints nothing, or fewer lines than it read. It only ever
#       replaces a line with more lines, so fewer means input was lost. (A
#       relative <unit.s> path is one way to get there: the file is read after
#       the `cd` above.)
#   (m) the caller passed the allowlist's host md5 as ASM_UNIT_DLISITES_MD5 and
#       the container's read never agreed with it (see below).
#
# MOUNT-SYNC OF THE ALLOWLIST (task #1205). The allowlist is host-written, and
# every row added GROWS it. A host write that grows a file is read TRUNCATED at
# the old length by a container that opens it within ~20 s of an earlier VM read
# (FACT #8713, which NARROWS #8705; reader-dependent, FACT #8683; the class is
# FACT #7449/#7464, tools/ee/mount_sync.sh). A cut that lands mid-row is refused
# as a malformed row, but a cut on a row boundary is a well-formed SHORTER
# allowlist: the row count cannot see it, and the dropped site assembles as GNU
# as's with no error. It has fired on a real build (ledger-29550: an
# objdiff_build run read the grown allowlist truncated). So a caller that can
# take the host md5 passes it as ASM_UNIT_DLISITES_MD5 (objdiff_build.sh,
# landing_gate.sh do_build), and mount_sync.sh's check re-reads until the
# container agrees, the #542 form used for $UNIT_S above. The verified bytes are
# then COPIED into a container-local file, and every read below (the count and
# the pass) reads that copy, so the two cannot see different allowlists. Unset,
# the copy is still taken but nothing can verify it against the host: a caller
# that writes the allowlist and builds within ~20 s must pass the md5.
#
# Every assembled unit prints one line on stderr (task #1205):
#   asm_unit.sh: dli: N transforms (M allowlist rows for <region>)
# N is the number of dli SITES the pass substituted in this unit, counted from
# its substitution markers in what reaches `as`; M is the allowlist's valid rows
# for <region>. That spelling is an INTERFACE: landing_gate.sh's ASMUNIT row
# knows it, and GATE-F3 (#1158) sums it per region. The words never inflect
