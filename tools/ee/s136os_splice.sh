# s136os_splice.sh — the s136os compile arm (task #1257, FACT #8810): compile a
# SELECTED function alone with SN 2.95.3 v1.36 `-fopt-stack` and splice its
# `.ent`..`.end` block into the unit's cc1 2.9 output, so the image carries C
# compiled by the compiler the ROM's function was built with.
#
#   sh tools/ee/s136os_splice.sh <region> <unit> <src> <unit.s> <GFLAG> [CC1EXTRA]
#   The 6th argument is the CALLER's S136EXTRA for the unit: the 2.9 compile's
#   CC1EXTRA unless the flag table gives this arm its own (RULING #9004).
#   e.g. sh tools/ee/s136os_splice.sh usa text/248B50 \
#            going-decompiled/src/usa/text/248B50.c $BUILD/.../248B50._u.s -G8 -fno-gcse
#
# ONE helper, two callers: build.sh (the image) and objdiff_build.sh (the unit
# report's sdk29 base), each between its cc1 2.9 step and asm_unit.sh. Runs
# INSIDE the ee-build container at the repo root, POSIX sh + awk. <unit.s> is
# replaced only on success; a unit with no selector row and no slot is left
# untouched.
#
# SELECTOR: tools/ee/s136os_functions.txt, one `<region> <unit> <function>`
# row per selected function (unit without extension, as objdiff names it).
# THE SOURCE SIDE of a selected function is its guard, re-predicated from
#     #ifndef TARGET_NATIVE / INCLUDE_ASM(...) / #else <C> / #endif
# to
#     #if !defined(TARGET_NATIVE) && !defined(S136OS_<fn>)
#     S136OS_SLOT(<fn>);
#     #else
#     <C>
#     #endif
# The 2.9 compile sees S136OS_SLOT, which emits only the asm comment
# `#S136OS_SLOT <fn>` (include_asm.h): no bytes, no INCLUDE_ASM. This helper
# compiles the same source with -DS136OS_<fn>, which opens THAT function's C
# (every other guard in the unit is unchanged, so the s136os TU is the unit as
# the 2.9 arm sees it plus that one body: the configuration FACT #8810
# measured), and replaces the slot line with the block. Native compiles the C,
# as before.
# ⇒ If this helper never runs, the slot assembles to NOTHING: the function is
#   absent from the object and every later byte of the image shifts, so a
#   skipped or no-op splice cannot read as cmp 0 (it would if the slot were the
#   INCLUDE_ASM it replaces).
#
# FATAL (rc 3, nothing written) — each lists every offender:
#   - a malformed selector row, or a row repeated;
#   - a row with no slot in <unit.s>, or a slot with no row (the source guard
#     and the selector disagree);
#   - the unit's s136 front end missing or not its pinned sha256: a `.c` unit
#     needs the SN 1.36 cc1 (0393bcd3..., FACT #8810), a `.cpp` unit the SN 1.36
#     cc1plus (78a0df90..., task #1284). A `.cpp` unit NEVER falls back to cc1:
#     an unprovisioned cc1plus is fatal (run scripts/fetch_ee_toolchain.sh);
#   - the s136 compile failing (for C++ that includes any cc1plus diagnostic
#     exit and a missing __gnu_compiled_cplusplus marker; ee_cc1.sh checks);
#   - the s136os output has no single `.ent <fn>`..`.end <fn>` block;
#   - SHAPE: the block switches section (rodata/data/sdata literal, jump table)
#     or references a `$L` label it does not define (a `$LC` string/float
#     literal). Those live outside the block and are not spliced, so such a
#     function is out of this arm's domain until the rodata side is solved.
#   - REFUSED (task #1326): once every block is spliced, a block would not
#     assemble as it did in its s136os TU: a symbol's gp-relative/absolute
#     class differs (ADDRESSING), or it needs a definition the s136os TU has
#     outside .ent..end and the 2.9 TU lacks (DEFINITION). See verify_block.
#     Without it these spliced silently and surfaced only as a whole-image cmp
#     (BuildTieDrawSegment, 328,879 B) or a link error (SelectSceneSubChunk).
#   - LENGTH (task #1531): once every block verifies, the spliced unit is
#     assembled (asm_unit.sh, as the caller does next) and any row whose
#     st_size differs from its ROM length is refused, naming both lengths in
#     words. The ROM length is read from the row's splat .s by rom_size (its
#     `nonmatching` header, which must equal its glabel..endlabel word count;
#     an .s that disagrees with itself is an ORACLE refusal). Without it a
#     short body spliced silently and only the image cmp saw it (#1509, #1512).
#     On success each row prints a `length:` line whose "built" number is
#     the assembled st_size read from nm and whose "ROM" number is
#     rom_size's, two separately sourced numbers (task #1566, length_lines).
#   Every FATAL leaves <unit.s> untouched: the splice works on a copy.
# THE COMPILE is `tools/ee/ee_cc1.sh s136`, the one place the C/C++ rule lives:
# a `.c` unit runs cpp + 1.36 cc1 (the command lines this helper ran before);
# a `.cpp` unit runs cpp -lang-c++, ONE extern "C" wrapper, and 1.36 cc1plus
# -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti — the same front-end handling as the unit's 2.9
# compile. Measured codegen-identical to 1.36 cc1 on every selector member,
# block for block (task #1284).
# The block's own `$L<n>` labels are renamed `$L<n>_s136_<fn>` (still `$L`, so
# local and absent from the symtab, as cc1's are) because both TUs number
# their labels from the same counter.
#
# .extern CARRY (task #1281, FACT #8838/#8842): gas decides a bare-symbol load's
# gp-relativity from `.extern <sym>, <size>` (-G8 units), and the 2.9 TU never
# saw the body that needs it, so the s136os TU's `.extern` lines for symbols
# <unit.s> does NOT declare are carried in front of the block. KEYED ON THE
# SYMBOL NAME: a symbol <unit.s> already declares, at any size, is never
# carried. Measured on the container's GNU as 2.40 (-G8): a size > -G declared
# BEFORE a use pins that use absolute and a later smaller size does not undo
# it, but a size <= -G placed BEFORE the use (as the carry places it) makes it
# gp-relative. So a carried `, 4`/`, 1` in front of the block overrode a unit's
# deliberate `.extern <sym>, 16` absolute device (1CA080.c, 1FFBA0.c,
# 235FE8.c) for the block AND every later use in the unit, and walled 6 rows.
# A symbol the unit never declares is unaffected by placement: gas defers that
# decision to the end of the file, so the carry still decides it as the s136os
# TU's own end-of-file line does — UNLESS the s136os TU declares it at two
# sizes, one > -G: the carry sorts them, so the last one in front of the block
# may not be the one in force there in the s136os TU. verify_block refuses that
# case (SelectSceneSubChunk's in-arm `.extern …Abs, 16` + cc1's `, 4`).

# Two conditions (task #1326, FACT #8838 + task #1309's three image failures):
#  (1) ADDRESSING: for each symbol the block names that either file declares
#      `.extern`, the gp-relativity GNU as gives the block's bare-symbol access
#      differs between the two files. The model, measured on the container's
#      GNU as 2.40 at -G8 (8 probes, task #1326; FACT #8853 had 4 of them):
#      if the last `.extern <sym>, N` BEFORE the use has N > G the access is
#      pinned absolute there; otherwise gas defers to the end of the file and
#      it is gp-relative iff the file's LAST size is in 1..G. The position is
#      the block's `.ent <fn>` in both files (cc1
#      prints no `.extern` inside .ent..end; a carried line sits in front of
#      it). This is what FACT #8838's
#      "size conflict" means: a conflict that leaves the class the same (the
#      unit's ,16 device before the block and cc1's ,4 at the end, which both
#      files carry) is admitted, one that flips it (BuildTieDrawSegment: the
#      s136os TU sized the store's symbol 4, the unit 16) is refused.
#  (2) DEFINITION: the block names a symbol the s136os TU DEFINES outside the
#      block — an asm equate `<sym> = …` / `.set <sym>, …` / `.equ`, a label,
#      `.comm`/`.lcomm` — and the spliced unit has no identical definition
#      line. That definition came from source the 2.9 TU did not see (an
#      equate inside the member's own guard arm: SelectSceneSubChunk), so the
#      block would link to nothing, or to a different definition.
# A text scan, so it fails CLOSED: anything it cannot see as identical in the
# unit (e.g. the same equate spelled differently) is a loud false refusal,
# never a false admit. Its bound: symbols defined only inside an `.include`d
# file are invisible to both sides alike, and the model covers bare-symbol
# macro accesses (explicit %gp_rel/%hi/%lo operands are unaffected by -G).
