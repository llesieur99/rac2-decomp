## Primary maintainer local-validation route

LP explicitly authorizes `llesieur99` (GitHub user ID 191315338) to rely on
completed local validation and merge without waiting for remote full suites
or the native queue. Use `scripts/merge_queue.py <PR> --expected-head <SHA>
--owner-local` for this explicitly selected route. It authenticates the account
and pins the actual PR head. GitHub does not attest that local tests passed.
Keep required local matching proofs, current inputs and appropriate tests;
never fabricate matching credit. Other accounts retain the protected queue
and required checks. Manual full CI remains available on demand.

For a first-time contributor, read [docs/CONTRIBUTOR-QUICKSTART.md](docs/CONTRIBUTOR-QUICKSTART.md)
and [toolchain/README.md](toolchain/README.md). Default to a fork/topic branch and
draft PR targeting `RAC2`; do not inherit the maintainer's direct-push permissions
or private environment. Every contributor must supply a legally acquired matching
ISO and the full tool suite before contribution work. Missing prerequisites block
that work; assist with setup, not an alternative contribution route. Never fabricate
matching claims or download an SDK from an unverified source.

Start or resume through [docs/CONTINUE.md](docs/CONTINUE.md). Read the optional
ignored `.local/ENVIRONMENT.md` pointer for machine-specific tools and current
private operational state. The public repository owns methods, task decisions
and proofs; no long pasted prompt or personal workspace details belong here.

Use the maintained [campaign workflow](docs/CAMPAIGN-WORKFLOW.md) for task selection,
packets, trials and complete batches. `config/campaign-register.json` is the one
authority for experiment history and task decisions. Generate queue/history views
through `scripts/campaign.py views`; do not maintain a parallel queue or overwrite
an unregistered view edit. Preserve negative trials and explicit reopening conditions.

Before function decompilation, use the [shared reservations](docs/CONTRIBUTOR-RESERVATIONS.md).
Claim a small lot and wait for acknowledged ownership; a local Git lock or open
PR does not reserve work across forks. Check the [nonmatching shelf](nonmatching/README.md)
for retained attempts and preserve their provenance. The shelf and reservation
ledger add no matching credit and do not replace campaign decisions or proofs.

Author C under `src/` and follow [source organization](docs/SOURCE-LAYOUT.md).
`candidates/` contains generated standalone compilation units. Keep declaration
context, explicit per-program placements and source/checker hashes coherent.
Source modules do not prove original object boundaries. A source inventory counts
authored variants separately from replicated loaded-code coverage and adds no credit.
Runtime/tool paths and trial inputs remain private outside the repository.

After updating integrated progress, run `python scripts/readme_progress.py` and
include `README.md` and `progress/decompilation.svg` in the same lot. The generated
table and bar use the validated boot and all 27 overlay proofs; CI rejects either
if stale. Keep the generated progress block markers and do not hand-edit its counts.

Write all repository documentation, code comments, user-facing messages,
catalogue descriptions and commit messages in English. Preserve measured game
identifiers, symbol names, program identities and pinned reference hashes.

Every PR targeting `RAC2` must follow [the PR description contract](docs/PR-DESCRIPTIONS.md)
and complete the repository template for its actual change. Report the validated
base, scope/ownership, reproducible commands and real outcomes, relevant matching
proofs and separate physical/unique deltas, limitations and provenance. Explain
non-applicable fields instead of inventing tests. The required description check
does not replace technical review, reservation acknowledgement or byte gates.

Use the detailed Lombyte commit style: a scoped subject such as `overlay:`,
`decomp:`, `compiler:`, `docs:` or `fix:`, followed by a substantive body.
Describe the concrete change and its technical reason, the measured scope and
before/after progress when relevant, and the validation actually performed.
State any remaining limitation needed to interpret the result. A subject alone
is insufficient for a substantive matching or tooling change.

Keep source, catalogue, object and integration proofs coherent. Regenerate
affected reviews and full loaded-byte gates after changing hashed inputs,
including translations of comments or catalogue descriptions. Publish only
authored source, structural identifiers and proof metadata; keep game bytes,
proprietary tools and private runtime artifacts outside the repository.
